# My Project Plan for Mars Expedition Simulation

After looking at the Inspect framework docs and figuring out which LLM to use, here's my rough plan for implementing this multi-agent dialogue thing:

## 1. Set Up Colab Notebook

I need to create a Colab notebook with these parts:
- Installing all the packages (transformers, inspect-ai, etc.)
- Loading the model (probably Llama 3 8B)
- Setting up the agent roles
- Connecting with Inspect framework
- Running the simulation
- Saving the results somewhere

## 2. Define the Agent Personalities

For this project I need two different agents:
- **Cautious Planner**: This one's all about safety, backup plans, and not rushing
- **Goal-Driven Strategist**: This one cares more about efficiency and getting things done

I'm not sure exactly how to implement these personalities yet, but I'll probably use the few-shot examples from the assignment.

## 3. Figure Out the "Internal Reasoning" Part

I want each agent to have some kind of "hidden scratchpad" that shows what they're thinking before they respond. I need to make each agent:
- Process what the other agent said
- Think about risks/benefits
- Come up with a response

This might be the hardest part since I'm not sure if I need to use a separate prompt for this or what.

## 4. Set Up Some Kind of Logging

I need to save all the dialogue turns with:
- Turn number
- Who's speaking
- Their role
- Their "internal thoughts"
- What they actually say
- Maybe some tags?

I will try using CSV.

## 5. Add the Mars Mission Constraints

Need to make sure the simulation includes these constraints:
- 180-day mission limit
- Limited resources (fuel, payload, oxygen)
- Decisions about tools, timelines, safety stuff
- Random problems like dust storms

I'm not sure if I need to explicitly code these in or just mention them in the initial prompt. Will figure this out as I go.
